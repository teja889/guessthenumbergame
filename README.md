In the "Guess the Number" game, the correct number that the user needs to guess is generated randomly by the computer at the beginning of each round. Here's how the game works:

1.The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 (you can adjust the range as needed) at the start of each round.

2.The user is prompted to enter their guess in the input field provided by the user interface.

3.The user's guess is compared to the random number generated by the computer. The game will provide feedback, indicating if the user's guess is too low or too high, or if it matches the generated number.

4.The user's goal is to make educated guesses to determine the correct number based on the feedback provided. The user may continue guessing within the allowed maximum attempts (in this case, 10 attempts).

5.If the user correctly guesses the generated number within the maximum attempts, the game will congratulate the user. The user's score is calculated based on the number of attempts made in that round.

6.The game will continue for the specified number of rounds (in this case, 3 rounds). After completing all rounds, the game will display the total score.

7.The game assigns a maximum number of attempts for each round. In the provided code, the maximum attempts allowed per round are set to 10, but you can adjust this value as needed.

8.For each round, the player's score is calculated using the following formula: score = maxAttempts - attempts + 1

9.The score is updated and displayed after each successful guess. The player's score accumulates as they progress through the rounds.

10.The game can also provide additional feedback based on the player's score. For example, if the player's score reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 50 or more), the game might display a message like "You're doing great!" to encourage the player.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The code uses Java's Swing library to create a graphical user interface for the game, making it user-friendly.

Random Number Generation: At the start of each round, a random number between 1 and 100 (you can adjust the range) is generated by the computer. The player's goal is to guess this number.

Guessing and Feedback: The player enters their guess into an input field and clicks the "Guess" button. The program provides feedback, telling the player if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Score Calculation: The score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken by the player to guess the correct number. A higher score is awarded for guessing with fewer attempts. The scoring formula is: score = maxAttempts - attempts + 1, where maxAttempts is the maximum number of allowed attempts (default is 10).

Multiple Rounds: The game is divided into multiple rounds (default is 3 rounds). After each round, a new random number is generated, and the player's score accumulates. The player can continue playing rounds until all rounds are completed.

Game Over: Once all rounds are finished, the game displays the total score. The "Guess" button is disabled, indicating the end of the game.
